<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Maj Straus</h2>

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>I am a 27 year old multimedia producer, born in Ljubljana, Slovenia. 
  After finishing high school I studied multimedia production, primarely 
  audio production at IAM (Institute & Academy of Multimedia) where I 
  graduated in october 2017. My biggest passions are musicianship (I'm a
  guitarist, a singer and a songwriter), working in music production, working out,
  cooking and, adding the latest, writing code and learning about Web Development and
  online marketing.</p>
<h3>What do I do?</h3>
<p>My current occupation is retail salesman at a guitar shop in Ljubljana, called BAM Guitar Center,
  where I'm also in charge of website editing and, as of the beginning of the year 2023
  I took the role of the branch manager.</p>
<p>As a side hustle I offer aduio production services to local musicians, which includes
  recording audio, editing, mixing and mastering, whilst guiding my clients through the production
  process and giving them valuable advice, when needed.</p>
<h3>What do I have planned for the future?</h3>
<p>I'm learning web development with a particular purpose, to expand my knowledge and find a job
  in the field of web developkment, website editing or online marketing. I'm certain I can
  somehow merge my experties in multimedia product creation, audio production and the newly
  acquired web development skills to offer a somewhat unique and holesome input to a hiring
  firm or future clients.</p>
<p>My top interests are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Game or Film sound design</li>
